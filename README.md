# Assignment B4
I selected **Option C**: to design the McDonald's Menu Shiny App from scratch

The McDonald's Menu Shiny App can be accessed through the following [Link](https://meredithxu123.shinyapps.io/McDonald_Meals/).

### Description of the McDonald's Menu Shiny App üìÉ
This McDonald's Menu Shiny App is mainly designed for the McDonald's lover but who is also on a temporary diet. The users are allowed to choose their accpted Calories intake range for a specific choosen category(s) from McDonald's Menu. There 7 features are designed for this app and the brief explaination for each feature are stated as below:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature #1:** Altered the overall appearance of my Shiny App using the shinytheme package. After comparing the different themes, I found out that **theme united** is the most suitable one to use. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature #2:** Added an McDonald image in the sidebarPanel to make the app itself more visualized

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature #3:** Allowed the user to search for multiple McDonald's menu categories at once instead of only a one at a time by using the `selectInput()` function with a parameter `multiple = TRUE`.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature #4:** Added a feature that allows the user to decide on the colours of the bars in the plot.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature #5:** Used the DT package to turn a static table into an interactive table, which allows the user to search and adjust the number of entries that could be presented

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature #6:** Added a feature that shows the number of results found whenever the filters are changed.
