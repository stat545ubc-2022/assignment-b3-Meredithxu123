# STAT545B: Assignment B3 

BC LIQUOR DATA SHINY APP 

## Introduction 📌
This repository is created for Meredith's Assignment B3 for UBC course STAT545A. I selected **Option A** to modify an already-existing BC Liquor Shiny App by adding 4 features. 
The modified BC Liquor Shiny App can be accessed through the following [Link](https://meredithxu123.shinyapps.io/BC_Liquor_Data/).

## Description of the modified BC Liquor Shiny App 📃

1️⃣ **Feature #1:** Added a feature that allows the user to search for multiple countries at once instead of only a one at a time.


2️⃣ **Feature #2:** Added a feature that allows the user to decide on the colours of the bars in the plot.


3️⃣ **Feature #3:** Added a feature that shows the number of results found whenever the filters are changed.

4️⃣ **Feature #4:** Used the DT package to turn a static table into an interactive table
